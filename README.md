# react-filter ⚡️

Filter data collections in React without any hassle 👌

- Uses **sifter.js** under the hood for query filtering
- Use a variety of default data sorting/filter options or supply your own (`useFilters` prop)
- Ships with pre-made dropdown, search, and item rendering components
- Use a child render prop to provide your own OR use the withReactFilter HOC to let `react-filter` handle the magic Kirby-style
